This application was developed in 2021 using the Java programming language for the purpose of completing a final project in the Object-Oriented Programming course. 
The application implements a simple banking system that facilitates users in performing transactions such as deposits, money transfers, and withdrawals. 
Users can also view additional information such as personal data, balance, and transaction history of money transfers. 
On the database side, the application uses SQLite due to its easy implementation and simple configuration.

Here some of additional information about the details of this application:

1. The SimpleBank application utilizes JFrame Swing for the user interface.
2. There are two types of database tables:
    - Account Table to store all user personal data.
    - Transaction Table to store money transfer transaction data performed by the user.
3. To perform various operations on the SQLite database, a JAR file named sqlite-jdbc is used.
4. Several additional JAR files are also utilized, including:
    - JCalendar to display the date in real-time.
    - JTattoo to change the default theme commonly used in Java Swing.
    - rs2xml to fetch data from the transaction database and display it in a specified table.
